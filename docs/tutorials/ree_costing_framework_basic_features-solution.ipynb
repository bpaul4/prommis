    "# REE Costing Framework Part 1 - Basic Features\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce the basic features and usage of the REE Costing Framework in PrOMMiS. The REE Costing Framework supports capital costs leveraging a built-in dictionary of reference data, as well as installation, fixed operating and variable operating costs calculated based on plant inputs. Capital cost calculations follow the general principle of economies of scale: as production increases, the cost per production of a particular unit operation decreases. As such, capital costs vary nonlinearly with capacity and are calculated via power law surrogate models in the costing framework. The cost of a single unit operation or cost account is denoted as the equipment cost, or the \"bare erected\" cost prior to installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Installation costs are calculated as percentage factors of the total sum of bare erected costs in the plant, and fixed operating costs are largely taken as percentage factors of the total plant cost or total revenue. Variable operating costs reflect the overall usage of consumables, such as chemicals or electricity, or the required cost of waste disposal. Plant overhead and land/leasing costs are considered variable costs within the framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial will take users through the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Adding capital costing to simple unit operation\n",
    "* Creating and using a custom cost account dictionary\n",
    "* Build capital and operating costing\n",
    "* Defining and adding custom additional costs\n",

If a time index does not exist on the main flowsheet and variable operating costs are built, a time index of `[0]` will be added to the flowsheet block.\n",

    "The costing block serves three purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the `QGESSCosting()` method imports a ready-made dictionary of currency units from IDAES supporting cost years from 1990-2023. These cost-year factors are sourced from the public source [Towering Skills](https://www.toweringskills.com/financial-analysis/cost-indices/), and enable conversion of economic results between different reference years. Currency units may be treated as any other Pyomo UOM (units of measurement), and instantiating the `QGESSCosting()` class adds the currency conversions to the Pyomo UOM library. The REE Costing module appends custom year-factor from public case studies that are not available in IDAES. For the purposes of this example, the default currency of `USD_2021` will be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the `QGESSCosting()` method supports building cost equations with the IDAES `UnitModelCostingBlock()` method for each unit model block. The created costing block serves as a parent block for unit model costing, and the REE Costing Framework only needs to reference a single block to build plant costing. For a usage example of IDAES costing, which utilizes unit model costing in a similar fashion, see the IDAES [Flowsheet Costing](https://github.com/IDAES/examples/blob/main/idaes_examples/notebooks/docs/flowsheets/hda_flowsheet_with_costing.ipynb) example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, the `QGESSCosting()` method contains all required capital and operating cost methods. After defining the unit model costing for each block in the flowsheet, a single `build_process_costs()` call builds all specified cost calculations. This will be discussed further in Step 3."

The argument `scale_down_parallel_equip` allows users to specify how trains of parallel units are treated. Setting this argument to `False` assumes that the scaling parameter is the capacity of each parallel unit, e.g. each leach tank in the train is identical and has a volume equal to `m.fs.leach.volume`.

    "When the flowsheet contains all desired unit models with capital cost variables and constraints, we can call the main method of the costing module to build plant-wide costing for the flowsheet.

Users must set three arguments on the build method: resources, a list of strings corresponding to the variable cost names; rates, a list of model variables corresponding to the resource flows; and prices, an optional argument to add prices for new resources or overwrite existing prices. To use the default prices, the resource name must match the names in the default price dictionary. The rates do not need to have the same units as the default dictionary, but they do need to be compatible, e.g. if using the default cost for \"diesel\", the rate object may have any units of volume per time."

Setting `feed_input` in units of mass per time adds a line to the `report()` method for the total annual operating cost per mass feed. Setting `recovery_rate_per_year` enables calculation of the overall recovery cost per year, created as an `Expression` named `cost_of_recovery`. Setting `transport_cost_per_ton_product` in units of cost per ton tells the framework to calculate a transport cost based on the recovery rate.\n",

The passed expressions are considered separately from any costs defined in `variable_operating_costs`, and users may define chemical and waste costs in one way, or both ways. Users may set a `land_cost`, which will be added to the variable O&M cost calculations. Finally, all three cost types (capital, fixed O&M, variable O&M) support additional costs defined as \"other\" costs. After the build method is called, users may use these variable to define custom costs.\n",

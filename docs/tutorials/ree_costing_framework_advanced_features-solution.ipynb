    "# 2 Import and Use Costing From WaterTAP\n",
    "\n",
    "The REE Costing Framework supports integration with costing methods imported from [WaterTAP](https://watertap.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), an external package for modeling water treatment operations such as aqueous membrane processes involving REE components. As demonstrated in [Part 1](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/GitHub/PrOMMiS/prommis/docs/tutorials/ree_costing_framework_basic_features.ipynb) of this tutorial, cost accounts imported from the built-in dictionary may be attached to either unit operation models or generic `UnitModelBlock` objects. In contrast, WaterTAP costing methods look for the unit model class, i.e. to import costing for a WaterTAP model the flowsheet needs to contain that WaterTAP model before calling `build_process_costs`. The heavy lifting for passing along unit model references, importing costing methods, and extracting the necessary capital and operating cost components occurs inside the REE Costing Framework. On the flowsheet side, users only need to define their unit models and pass them to the costing method.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1 Build a flowsheet to cost\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we will build a flowsheet containing one PrOMMiS model, one WaterTAP model, and one `UnitModelBlock` representing a supplemental unit to be costed. We'll see that the the `build_process_costs` method will automatically extract the relevant costing from all three models.\n",

The method `build_global_params` defines the base cost year and period for the model. Since the class inherits all properties of the `FlowsheetCostingBlockData` class, the final model will return cost variables in units of `USD_2021` and any time units will be in `year` or `a` (annum, the two are equivalent in Pyomo unit container syntax).\n",

The NPV represents the total value of the plant construction, operation, and production over the plant lifetime taking into account the changing worth of money over time. For example, distributed capital costs over multiple years or operating costs per year over the entire lifetime of a plant may grow with an escalation or inflation rate. The NPV provides a way to normalize costs over time to the current dollar year. Typical NPV components include capital cost, operating cost, revenue (this is a positive contribution); additionally, royalties from product sales and depreciation that reduces equipment resale value at the end of the plant lifetime are included in the NPV calculation.\n",

    "\n",
    "Finally, the costing framework supports calculating costing bounds based on the feedstock capacity and grade of a process. Unlike the NPV method, the costing bounding method is independent of the main costing framework. The bound equations derive from Fritz, A.G., Tarka, T.J. & Mauter, M.S. Assessing the economic viability of unconventional rare earth element feedstocks. Nat Sustain 6, 1103–1112 (2023). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41893-023-01145-1. The study establishes a database of capital and operating expenses for REE recovery and market prices of saleable mineral products, and develops surrogates models to predict the maximum cost threshold of specific process types to determine the economic viability. Thresholds are calculated using a power law:\n",

    "The advanced method demonstrated here expand upon the capabilities of the REE Costing Framework. Syntax for the example WaterTAP and custom models may be applied to any imported WaterTAP or custom model, respectively, and it is recommended that additional unit operation specificaitions are placed prior to calling the `build_process_costs`. The NPV calculations must be set up when instantiating the flowsheet costing block itself, as shown in this notebook, while the costing bounding equations are entirely independent of the capital and operating cost equations and may be added at any point while building the flowsheet."

    "# REE Costing Framework Part 2 - Advanced Features\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce advanced features available through the REE Costing Framework in PrOMMiS. To learn the basics of the REE Costing Framework, please refer to [Part 1](ree_costing_framework_basic_features-solution.ipynb) of this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates advanced features of the REE Costing Framework. Most of the methods described here complement the basic costing framework to add complexity and enabled more detailed cost modeling. Standalone methods will be identified where applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial will take users through the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Importing the required tools from PrOMMiS and related repositories\n",
    "2. Importing and using cost models from WaterTAP\n",
    "3. Writing and importing custom, user-defined cost models\n",
    "4. Calculating net present value and tax estimation\n",
    "5. Standalone method for predicting process costs using economy of numbers\n",
    "6. Standalone method for estimating cost bounds for general process types\n",

    "# 2 Import and Use Costing From WaterTAP\n",
    "\n",
    "The REE Costing Framework supports integration with costing methods imported from [WaterTAP](https://watertap.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), an external package for modeling water treatment operations such as aqueous membrane processes involving REE components. As demonstrated in [Part 1](ree_costing_framework_basic_features-solution.ipynb) of this tutorial, cost accounts imported from the built-in dictionary may be attached to either unit model blocks or generic `UnitModelBlock` objects. In contrast, WaterTAP costing methods look for the unit model class, i.e. to import costing for a WaterTAP model the flowsheet needs to contain that WaterTAP model before calling `build_process_costs`. The costing framework handles passing unit model references, importing costing methods, and extracting the necessary capital and operating cost components. On the flowsheet side, users only need to define their unit models and pass them to the costing method.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1 Build a flowsheet to cost\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we will build a flowsheet containing one PrOMMiS model, one WaterTAP model, and one `UnitModelBlock` representing a supplemental unit to be costed. We'll see that the `build_process_costs` method will automatically extract the relevant costing objects from all three models.\n",

    "There are a few important details in the model above. First, the decorator `@declare_process_block_class()` tells the Python interpreter to register the new class as an importable object with the name \"CustomCosting\". The class inherits all properties of the `FlowsheetCostingBlock` class by calling its corresponding data class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line inside the custom class defines a new cost unit `USD_custom` with a Chemical Engineering Plant Cost Index (CEPCI) value of 700. `USD_CE500` is a reference unit container enabling conversion between currency units. The method `build_global_params` defines the base cost year and period for the model. Since the class inherits all properties of the `FlowsheetCostingBlockData` class, the final model will return cost variables in units of `USD_2021` and any time units will be `year` or `a` (annum, the two are equivalent in Pyomo unit container syntax).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the method `cost_custom_vessel` defines all cost equations. Each of the three cost variables (capital, fixed operating, variable operating) is built by defining a cost per unit with appropriate inputs, and then a total cost based on the number of units. The naming convention is important, since the REE Costing Framework will look for variables named `capital_cost`, `fixed_operating_cost`, and `variable_operating_cost` when building the process cost equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, note that the currency units are set as `costing_package.base_currency` everywhere in the custom model. The object `costing_package` is the main flowsheet costing class set by the user, so the model will automatically use those default cost units. The examples below will demonstrate this further."

    "\n",
    "If all required capital, fixed operating, and variable operating costs are calculated or provided, the REE Costing Framework supports estimation of the net present value (NPV). The NPV represents the total value of the plant construction, operation, and production over the plant lifetime taking into account the changing worth of money over time. For example, distributed capital costs over multiple years or operating costs per year over the entire lifetime of a plant may grow with an escalation or inflation rate. The NPV provides a way to normalize costs over time to the current dollar year. Typical NPV components include capital cost, operating cost, revenue (this is a positive contribution); additionally, and cash flows from capital loan repayment are included in the NPV calculation.\n",

    "To calculate the NPV as part of the `build_process_costs` method, certain configuration arguments must be set when the flowsheet costing block is instantiated. The NPV calculation method will assume both fixed and variable operating costs exist, as they are required to calculate the NPV. Users may provide their own values instead to bypass this requirement (see Section 4.2).\n",

Income tax is typically set by local laws applying to the construction site, whereas royalties are charged by the land owner.

    "The cost of manufacturing a piece of equipment tends to decline as the production quantity increases (economy of scales), but also as new generations of that equipment are developed leading to increases in technical knowledge (economy of numbers).

    "The advanced method demonstrated here expand upon the capabilities of the REE Costing Framework. Syntax for the example WaterTAP and custom models may be applied to any imported WaterTAP or custom model, respectively, and it is recommended that additional unit operation specificaitions are placed prior to calling the `build_process_costs`. The NPV calculations must be set up when instantiating the flowsheet costing block itself, as shown in this notebook, while the costing bounding equations are entirely independent of the capital and operating cost equations and may be added at any point while building the flowsheet."
